        <h2>Facts about Joanne Rowling</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle; width: 50%;">
        
            <li>She was rejected by 12 publishers since they thought the 1<sup>st</sup> book was "too long"! Her 13<sup>th</sup> publisher had given the book's 1<sup>st</sup> chapter to his daughter who wanted more! The publisher published the book which became a huge success.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The time when Rowling's 1<sup>st</sup> book was almost published, people asked her to change her name. They beleived that boys wouldn't like to read a book written by a woman. Joanne thus and a K was added to her name which stands for Kathleen, her maternal grandmother, who was also her godmother! Thus, getting her the pen-name, J.K. Rowling.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Joanne was also forced to change the name of her 1<sup>st</sup> book, 'The Philosopher's Stone' to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' since they thought that kids would want to read a book with the title 'Sorcerer' rather than a book with the title 'Philosopher' since the name didn't sound 'magical' to describe the story. Rowling regreted this afterword but since she was under difficulties that time, she had agreed to change the name of her book.</li>
